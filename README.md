# Twomes hardware repository template

This repository contains the open hardware design files for the Twomes something device, which can be used as a [WeMos D1 Mini shield](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1_mini_shield/index.html), on top of a WeMos D1 Mini board, such as the [LilyGO TTGO T7 Mini32 V1.3 ESP32](https://github.com/LilyGO/ESP32-MINI-32-V1.3), which is based on an ESP32 SoC, or the [Wemos LOLIN D1 mini](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini.html), which is based on an ESP8266 SoC. 

Describe the function of the shiels.

## General info
This repository will contain the hardware designs, such as schematics and board layout files for the Twomes something shield.

For the associated firmwware that you can run on this device, please see [this repository](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-opentherm-gateway-diyless).

## Prerequisites
Describe which hardware and software you need to produce and/or develop the hardawre. If the prerequisites are different for users that only wish to produce hardware versus uers that (also) wish to develop new versions of the hardware, you may want to move the prerequisites section as a subsection of each of those sections.

## Producing

Describe how the reader use the files contained in this repository to produce the PCB hardware and enclusure(s). 

### Printed Ciruit Board
Document how to order (small) series of PCBs from a PCB fabrication service, including SMT assembly if the design calls for it. Use steps if the procedure is non-trivial:
1. first step;
2. second step;
3. final step.

Format any scripts or commands in a way that makes them  easy to copy, like the following example. 

Forgotten your Wi-Fi password? No problem with the follwing command, replacing `SSID` with the Wi-Fi name of your own Wi-Fi network: 
```shell
netsh wlan show profile SSID key=clear
```
### Enclosure
Document how to print (small) series of enclosures, e.g. on a 3D printer, and/or how to order enclusures, e.g. from a 3D printing service. Use steps if the procedure is non-trivial:
1. first step;
2. second step;
3. final step.

Format any scripts or commands in a way that makes them  easy to copy, like the following example. 

Forgotten your Wi-Fi password? No problem with the follwing command, replacing `SSID` with the Wi-Fi name of your own Wi-Fi network: 
```shell
netsh wlan show profile SSID key=clear
```

## Developing
Describe how the reader can change or extend the harware design. 

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development. Ready:
* awesome feature 1;
* awesome feature 2;
* awesome feature 3.

To-do:
* wow improvement to be done 1;
* wow improvement to be done 2.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
